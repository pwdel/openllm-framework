Mathematical Framework Describing the Goal of Open-LLM's for UMN Math Presentation

### The Goal of Encoding

In general, Precision, or Output Precision is a metric used in binary classification tasks to evaluate the accuracy of the positive predictions made by a model. It's defined as:

```math
\text{Output Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
```

Roughly speaking:

```math
\text{Output Precision} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Encoding Errors}}
```
